	<p>
		The wooden doors of the Gambling Den's front entrance are propped open, allowing you to easily make your way forwards into the establishment. As you enter, you find yourself standing in a very large entrance hall. A sign hanging from the ceiling in front of you reads 'Welcome to the Gambling Den!', and from somewhere further within the building, you hear the distinctive sounds of laughter, conversation, and then of a slot machine dispensing coins to a lucky winner. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Although there only a few people loitering around in this entrance hall, the constant drone of chatter coming from up ahead lets you know that this place must be quite popular. As you start to walk forwards, intent on exploring the establishment, a voice suddenly calls out from your right-hand side, [axel.speech(Hello there! I haven't seen you here before!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning towards the source of the voice, you see a tall, muscular alligator-boy grinning at you. The scales covering his body are all a brilliant white, and as he comes to a halt in front of you, his pair of bright blue eyes lock onto yours, and he continues, [axel.speech(I'm Axel, the owner of this place, and I like to say hello to every fresh face I see!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I'm [pc.name],)] you reply, returning the alligator-boy's greeting as he happily reaches out to shake your hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(It's a pleasure to meet you! Now, if you're looking to have some fun, you've come to the right place. We've got dice poker straight ahead down the hall here,)] Axel says, pointing one of his clawed hands forwards, before turning it to the right and continuing, [axel.speech(and the slot machines are lining the main atrium down to the right there. If you continue on down to the very end, you'll find my good friend Epona, who runs our very special 'pregnancy roulette' game! You can get all the details of that from her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Thanks,)] you say, [pc.speech(I'll go and check it all out.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Oh, and, erm, we've also got a shop,)] Axel says, the friendly tone of his voice shifting into one of discomfort. [axel.speech(Roxy's the one that runs it. Just be careful around her, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok, I'll see you around,)] you say, letting Axel hurry off to one side of the hall before moving off to explore the building.

		To one side of the hall, you see the large, muscular figure of Axel, the owner of this establishment. The albino alligator-boy looks to be busy keeping a close watch over everyone who comes and goes.

		To the left-hand side of the Gambling Den's main entrance, there's a sturdy wooden door bearing a brass plaque engraved with the words 'Axel's Office'. At the moment, it's securely shut and locked, so there's not really much for you to do except turn around and step away from the door...

		[axel.speech(Ah, hello, [pc.name]!)] he responds, turning to face you. You notice that he sounds a little flustered as he asks, [axel.speech(What can I do for you?)]

	<p>
		[axel.speech(Yeah, she's nothing but trouble.)] Axel sighs. [axel.speech(If it were up to me, I'd have thrown her out a long time ago. Seeing as she's Vengar's ex, and the two of them are still on good terms with one another, I've got no choice but to leave her alo-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Axel suddenly stops talking mid-sentence, and upon realising that he's said more than he meant to, starts to panic and stutter, [axel.speech(I-I mean, she's no trouble at all, ok? I never really meant to say that I want to throw her out! I was just joking, you understand?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(What's the matter?)] you ask, worried about Axel's sudden shift in tone, [pc.speech(And who's Vengar?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Axel glances around nervously, before leaning in towards you and lowering his voice, [axel.speech(Y-You mean you're not working for him?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I don't even know who he is,)] you reply.
	</p>
	<p>
		Axel lets out a big sigh of relief, [axel.speech(Thank goodness. I've been getting careless recently. I really shouldn't have mentioned Vengar... Just forget what I said, ok?)]

			[axel.speech(Well, other than that she's Vengar's ex-girlfriend, I don't really know much about her,)] the [axel.race] replies, [axel.speech(That is, other than the obvious fact that she's extremely rude. She treats me like dirt whenever I try talking to her, so I've never been able to find out anything about her.)]

			[pc.speech(And you can't get rid of her due to Vengar?)] you ask.
		</p>
		<p>
			[axel.speech(That's right, but even if Vengar was no longer a problem, I'd still be stuck with her. She made me sign a contract, you see, so there's nothing that can legally be done to get rid of her now...)]

		</p>
		<p>
			You can tell that Axel is lying, and you surmise that it's because he doesn't know you well enough to be openly talking to you about Roxy. Perhaps if you were to try and get some more information regarding this 'Vengar' person first, you'd be able to earn his trust and then ask him about Roxy again?

		Picking up on the name which Axel inadvertently let slip, you inquire as to who 'Vengar' is, and why Roxy being his ex makes it so that Axel has to put up with her.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(You mean you don't know who Vengar is?)] Axel asks, before nervously glancing around to make sure that nobody's eavesdropping on your conversation. Convinced that it's safe to talk, he steps a little closer towards you and continues, [axel.speech(I guess you'll just end up going around asking questions elsewhere if I don't explain it to you, so I'll tell you who Vengar is. He likes to keep a low profile, so please don't mention to anyone that it was me who told you about him, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You can tell from the tone of Axel's voice that he's scared to be talking about this 'Vengar' character, so you quickly reassure him that any information that he shares with you will remain a secret. Put at ease by your words, the albino [axel.race] lets out a small sigh, before once again glancing around to check for eavesdroppers, and then starting to explain.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Vengar's the leader of the largest and most dangerous criminal gang down here in Submission,)] he reveals, [axel.speech(He and his rat-morph followers extort all of the business owners down here, and those who refuse to pay protection money either have their premises vandalised, or even worse, are sometimes beaten up or even go missing. Thanks to how successful my business has been, Vengar's taken a personal interest in me, and keeps on demanding more and more protection money every month. It's gotten almost to the point where I'm going to have to shut the Gambling Den down...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Can't the Enforcers do anything?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(I've already tried talking to them about it, but they say they don't have the manpower to guard my business, and while Vengar <i>is</i> a wanted criminal, he's proving impossible to track down and arrest,)] Axel sighs, [axel.speech(So there's nothing anyone can do to help, and that's about the whole story...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		It sounds as though Axel doesn't want to talk about this any more, but if you wanted to get involved, you suppose you could always offer to help track down Vengar and put a stop to his extortion of Submission's business owners...

	<p>
		[axel.speech(Really? You'd be willing to help me out like that?)] Axel asks in disbelief, [axel.speech(I wouldn't want you to risk yourself on my behalf, but if you're really serious, then you can find Vengar in his hideout; they call it the 'Rat Warrens', and it's down in the South-Western tunnels here in Submission. I have to go down there every month to pay Vengar, so I can tell you that the password to get in is ''.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling Axel that you'll find Vengar and bring him to justice, you get ready to set off, but before you go, the albino [axel.race] says that he has some more advice for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(You could always try to get the Enforcers to help,)] he suggests, [axel.speech(They weren't able to help me before, but as you're willing to take a more direct approach, maybe they'd offer you some help? Oh, and I should also warn you; if you're thinking of fighting Vengar, then you need to be on the lookout for his two rat-girl bodyguards. I've never seen them myself, but Vengar said that if I ever refused to pay him, then I'd be given to them as a plaything...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Axel shudders as he recalls a disturbing memory, before shaking his head and giving you a toothy smile. [axel.speech(I really appreciate your offer of help, but please don't feel obliged to put yourself in harm's way solely on my account. If you do decide to confront Vengar, just please stay safe, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling Axel that you'll be careful, you wonder if you should do as he suggests and ask Claire for some help from the Enforcers. Then again, you could always try to deal with Vengar by yourself...

		The wide, spacious atrium of the Gambling Den is filled with the laughter and chatter of at least a hundred customers. Looking around, you see all manner of races, not just the usual alligator and rat-morphs which make up most of Submission's population.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lining the walls of this vast hall are countless slot machines, in front of which sit the vast majority of the people in this area. Down the middle of the hall, numerous tables and chairs have been set out, and it's here that the rest of the establishment's patrons are drinking and playing casual gambling games with one another.

		In one corner of the Gambling Den's central atrium, several pairs of glass doors have been propped open to grant easy access to a huge, adjoining hall, which is dedicated solely to the immensely popular game of dice poker. At least fifty tables are scattered around the hall's floor, and although each one only seats two players, there are far more than a hundred people present, as around most of the tables, large crowds of onlookers have gathered around to watch ongoing games.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hall is split into three sections, with each one decorated in copper, silver, or gold. The copper section is by far the largest, and from the nearby signs, you gather that these are the tables at which the betting is lowest. The silver section is roughly half the size of the copper one, and is a place where gamblers are willing to bet considerable sums of money on the outcome of their games. Finally, the gold section is the smallest of all three, and is reserved for players willing to bet huge sums of money.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the vast majority of tables are occupied, you can spot at least one in each section which has just one player sitting at it. If you wanted to, you could walk up to one of these tables and sit down for a game, or you could walk up to one of the nearby signs to read about the rules of dice poker.

	<p>
		Deciding to read the rules of dice poker before starting a game, you walk up to the nearest informative sign, and briefly scan over it...
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		<b>Axel's Rules For Dice Poker</b><br/>
		1. Both players place the buy-in amount to start a game. This is [style.moneyFormat(500, span)] for [style.colourCopper(copper)] tables, [style.moneyFormat(2500, span)] for [style.colourSilver(silver)], and [style.moneyFormat(10000, span)] for [style.colourGold(gold)].<br/>
		2. Both players roll five dice each.<br/>
		3. Players can choose to increase the bet (referred to as a 'raise'), or leave the bet at the buy-in amount (referred to as a 'call').<br/>
		4. After betting is done, each player selects as many of their dice as they want to re-roll.<br/>
		5. The players re-roll their chosen dice.<br/>
		6. The ranking of each player's dice is compared to find the winner, who then takes all of the money in the pot.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		<b>Results ranking (from winning to losing)</b><br/>
		1. Five of a kind: Five dice of the same value. (e.g. 33333)<br/>
		2. Four of a kind: Four dice of the same value. (e.g. 55551)<br/>
		3. High straight: Consecutive numbers starting at two. (e.g. 23456)<br/>
		4. Full house: Two dice of the same value, plus three dice of a different, same value. (e.g. 22666)<br/>
		5. Three of a kind: Three dice of the same value. (e.g. 44415)<br/>
		6. Low straight: Consecutive numbers starting at one. (e.g. 12345)<br/>
		7. Two pair: Two dice of the same value, plus two dice of a different, same value. (e.g. 55331)<br/>
		8. Pair: Two dice of the same value. (e.g. 22415)<br/>
		9. Runt: All dice of different values. (e.g. 13456)<br/><br/>
		
		If both players have the same ranking, the total value of the dice that make up their rank are compared. For example:<br/>
		Player A: 33661<br/>
		Player B: 22115<br/>
		Although both players have 'Two pair', player A wins, as the total of their ranking dice is 18 (3+3+6+6), compared to player B's 6 (2+2+1+1).<br/><br/>
		
		If both players have the same ranking, and the same value, the game is a draw, and the money in the pot is returned to each player's hand.

		Set into the far right corner of the Gambling Den's main atrium, there's a wide, open archway, which leads into a small room. The interior of this room is concealed from public view by means of a dark blue canvas privacy screen, which bears a stylised black silhouette of a horse-boy sporting a massive erection. Beneath this icon, you read the words 'Pregnancy Roulette: Male breeder room'.

		Seeing as there's nobody around to stop you, you decide to step into the room and take a closer look at what lies beyond. Moving forwards, you peek around the side of the canvas screen, and find yourself looking upon a small, wooden-floored room. The only furnishings in this area are a couple of basic wooden tables and benches, which have been pushed up against the left and right-hand walls.

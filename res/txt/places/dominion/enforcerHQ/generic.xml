		Being built in an extremely imposing example of brutalist architecture, the vast structure before you is strikingly different from the usual residential buildings which Dominion is mostly comprised of. A wide courtyard, paved in drab, grey flagstones and cordoned off with chain bollards, separates the street on which you're standing from this unusual property. Looking up at the fa√ßade, which is made almost entirely out of sheets of reflective glass and thick pillars of grey concrete, you see that there's a sign bearing the words "Enforcer Headquarters, Blackhall'.
	</p>
	<p>
		As if the sign wasn't enough to reveal this establishment's purpose to any passersby, there are also a half-dozen or so groups of smartly-dressed
		#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_MAGIC_STORM)
			 demon
		#ENDIF
		 Enforcers loitering about the courtyard, with several more standing guard at each of the three main entrances. While the signs beside two of these doorways inform you that they're for Enforcer use only, the third bears the words 'Public Inquiries, open 24/7'. If you had any sort of business to conduct here, then this would be the door for you.

		A pair of glass doors link the outside world to the small entrance hall that you find yourself standing in. There's a noticeboard hanging from a nearby wall, covered in posters and information leaflets of all kinds. Other than that, however, this room is completely empty, and you'll have to proceed through another set of internal doors if you wanted to enter the building proper.

A reception desk is built into the left-hand wall, and you see Candi, the cat-girl bimbo, sitting behind it. She has long, bleach-blonde hair, a beautiful face that's been completely plastered in makeup, and a massive pair of G-cup breasts that threaten to spill out of her half-buttoned-up shirt at any moment. Her cute cat-like ears twitch this way and that as she stares into a little mirror on her desk, and you notice that she's busy applying a layer of bright pink lipstick to her plump lips.

				Candi reaches down to tug on something, and you hear a familiar voice respond, [brax.speech(Candi, please, I don't wa-)]
			</p>
			<p>
				[brax.namePos] protest is cut off as Candi stands up, sharply yanking on what you now see to be a pink leash. [candi.speechNoEffects(Bad pet! Bad! You, like, have to do as I say! The chief said so, remember?!)]
			</p>
			<p>
				Letting out another groan, [brax.name] crawls out from under Candi's desk and stands up to face you. A look of shock crosses his face, and he desperately pulls on his leash as he shouts out, [brax.speech(That's [pc.herHim]! Candi! That's the one who took the documents! Call the chie- ~Aargh!~)]
			</p>
			<p>
				[brax.namePos] leash is suddenly and violently yanked backwards, immediately interrupting his accusation and causing him to choke and splutter.

While at first it looked as though she was completely engrossed in doing her makeup, you now see that she has in fact angled the mirror in front of her in such a way that she's looking down into her own lap. Following her gaze, you see that her skirt has been pulled up, and her right hand is frantically rubbing away at her exposed pussy.

		As [brax.name] is now registered as a slave, you realise that this means you'd potentially be able to own [brax.herHim], if only you can convince Candi to sell [brax.herHim] to you. With this on your mind, you inform the bimbo cat-girl that you're in possession of a slaver's license, and ask how much she'd be willing to consider selling [brax.name] for.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_bimbofiedBrax))

	</p>
	<p>
		Reaffirming that you would indeed like to buy [brax.name] from her, you again ask how much she'd be willing to sell [brax.herHim] for. Leaning back in her chair, Candi lets out a long sigh, before saying, [candi.speechNoEffects(Like, I dunno... I mean, it's kinda annoying having to care for a slave, but, like, it's also kinda fun to get [brax.herHim] to do what I say... I'll tell ya what; I'll, like, really think about if I wanna sell [brax.herHim] to you, but you gotta do something for me first.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After asking Candi what that 'something' would be, she smiles and places a small bag of coins on the desk in front of her, before saying, [candi.speechNoEffects(I, like, ordered some perfume and stuff from this nice succubus lady a week or something ago, and, like, I just haven't had the time to go and pick it up yet, y'know? You just, like, take this money, go pay for my perfume, and bring it back to me, and I'll, like, let you know if [brax.name] is for sale or not. Deal?)]

			As it sounds like an easy enough task, you agree to do as Candi asks, and after taking the bag of flames, you're informed that the shop at which the perfume is waiting is named 'Succubi's Secrets', and is located in one corner of the Shopping Arcade.

		 Telling Candi that you'll have no trouble retrieving her perfume for her, you wonder if you should head off to the Shopping Arcade right away, or hang around here for a little while longer...

		Telling Candi that you've done as she asked, you place the bottles of perfume on the desk before her. The cat-girl's eyes light up as she sees what it is you're delivering to her, and in a happy voice, she exclaims, [candi.speechNoEffects(Wohoo! Like, that succubus lady who works there really knows her stuff! She knew, like, exactly what brands I was talking about! This is, like, the real good stuff, y'know?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Reminding Candi about her end of the deal, you ask her if she's decided whether she'll sell [brax.name] to you or not. Putting the bottles of perfume away beneath her desk, the cat-girl straightens back up and smiles at you as she answers, [candi.speechNoEffects(Like, I was thinking no, but after you've gone and got me these super duper perfumes, there's, like, no way I could refuse!

			[candi.speechNoEffects(Shut up already! Fuck! You're, like, the worst fuckin' slave ever! I'm gonna be glad to be rid of you!)] Candi screeches, yanking harshly on [brax.namePos] leash to shut [brax.herHim] up. Glaring angrily at [brax.herHim], she then continues, [candi.speechNoEffects(And the chief, like, had all your papers signed to me personally, so, like, if I wanna sell you, that's up to me! Now, like, try to be a good bitch for once and stay quiet while I, like, think about how much to sell you for!)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning back towards you, Candi then says, [candi.speechNoEffects(So, um, I'm gonna need some time to think. If you're really serious about buying my bitch here, then I'm gonna need you to prove it. While I'm thinkin' about what to charge ya, I want you to do something for me, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Realising that you have little choice but to do as she asks, you agree to help Candi once again, and ask her what it is she needs you to do. Glancing around to make sure that nobody else is nearby, the bimbo cat-girl leans forwards over her desk, and in an overly-dramatic manner, places a finger over her lips and makes a shushing noise, before whispering, [candi.speechNoEffects(You, like, can't tell anyone about this, ok, but, like, I overheard some talk about these extra special lollipops being confiscated up in the Harpy Nests. I, um, really love sucking on things like that, so you're gonna, like, go and fetch them for me, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You almost put a quick end to Candi's entire plan as you point out that the Enforcers are unlikely to simply hand over contraband lollipops to a member of the public, but after letting out a particularly long 'umming' noise, she exclaims, [candi.speechNoEffects(Oh, you can just use the super secret password that, like, only enforcers are allowed to know! Just tell them it's a 'priority thunder', and then they'll know you must be a friend! Lucky I'm so smart I could think of that for you, huh? So anyway, go up to those Harpy Nests, and, like, tell them that the 'contraband lollipops' are needed here at the enforcer headquarters for, um, testing or something, I dunno, you'll think of something.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After getting Candi's assurance that she'll have put a price on [brax.name] by the time you return with these lollipops, you wonder if you should head on up to the Harpy Nests right away, or do something else here first...

		Placing the box down on the desk before Candi, you tell her that it contains the contraband lollipops she was after. Although you relay the warning that the dog-boy Enforcer gave you about the lollipops containing a dangerous, permanent aphrodisiac, the bimbo cat-girl doesn't seem to take much notice, and dismisses the message with a wave of her hand, [candi.speechNoEffects(Yeah, yeah, dangerous lollipops, sure, like, whatever.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Reminding her that she'd promised to put a price on [brax.name] by the time you returned with these lollipops, you ask Candi how much she's willing to sell the [brax.race] for. Stopping half-way through impatiently opening the box, Candi sighs and says, [candi.speechNoEffects(Yeah, like, I really tried to think hard, y'know, but I just don't think I can put a price on [brax.herHim]... Maybe I can't sell [brax.herHim] after all?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After expressing your displeasure at having the cat-girl go back on her word, and throwing out the casual observation that she would get into a lot of trouble if it was known that she'd obtained these lollipops for her own personal use, you once again ask Candi what price she's going to put on [brax.name]. This time, with the thought of getting into trouble over these lollipops clearly in her head, she says, [candi.speechNoEffects(Well, like, I don't think I could, um, ask for flames for [brax.herHim]... There is one thing I'd be, like, willing to trade [brax.herHim] for, though. There was this super rare, super exclusive, limited-edition set of lipsticks put out by, like, the best brand out there a few months ago, right? Like, obviously, they were all bought by super rich demons and stuff, but I heard from a friend's cousin's girlfriend that there's still one set for sale over in the Shopping Arcade. You, like, get that for me, and I'll trade you [brax.name] for it.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally having got a price set on [brax.namePos] head, you ask Candi where exactly this lipstick set is for sale, and how you're supposed to tell it apart from any others.
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Well, like, I heard it's being sold in that 'Ralph's Snacks' place, but you, like, have to ask for it all special-like and stuff, y'know? It's not displayed to the public. Oh, and the set's called 'A Hundred Kisses', so you just need to ask for that, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Agreeing to retrieve this special lipstick set in order to trade it for [brax.name], you wonder if you should head over to 'Ralph's Snacks' right away, or do something else first...

	<p>
		Wanting to finally become the owner of [brax.name], you place the lipstick set 'A Hundred Kisses', down on the desk in front of Candi. Seeing what it is you've brought her, the bimbo cat-girl lets out an excited squeal, [candi.speechNoEffects(~Aah!~ Like, no way! You actually got it! I, like, totally can't even!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Bouncing up and down in excitement, Candi reaches forwards to take the box, but, not wanting to hand it over until you know that she's going to keep her end of the bargain, you pull it away from her. Responding to her protestations with the simple demand that she produce the paperwork for signing over [brax.name], you soon manage to get her to do as you ask. Once the correct forms for a slave transfer are laid out before you, you allow Candi to take the lipsticks.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_bimbofiedBrax))
			[brax.speechNoEffects(So, like, I'm getting you as my new owner?)] [brax.name] asks, biting her lip and batting her eyelids at you.
		#ELSEIF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_feminisedBrax))
			[brax.speechNoEffects(So... Y-You're going to be the one owning me now?)] [brax.name] asks, nervously shuffling her feet as she wonders how you're going to be treating her.
		#ELSE

		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Responding in the affirmative, you sign the papers laid out in front of you, before asking Candi to do the same. Despite all that you've done for her, she seems very reluctant to go through with it, and it takes some pointed reminders of her promises to finally get her to sign off on the transfer. Being infused with a special arcane enchantment, the documents immediately react to both party's signatures, and with a bright purple flash, the enslavement collar around [brax.namePos] next activates, teleporting [brax.herHim] to the slaver administration building's holding cells.
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Well, like, there ya go,)] candi pouts, clearly upset at having lost her slave, [candi.speechNoEffects(I guess these lipsticks are, like, pretty good, but I feel like you cheated me outta something!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not wanting an enforcer with a grudge on your back, you remind Candi that you also retrieved her perfume, as well as the box of contraband lollipops, and that by all accounts it was a fair deal. As you mention this, her eyes suddenly light up, and she happily exclaims, [candi.speechNoEffects(Oh, that's right! I, like, forgot about those! I was saving them for when this happened to make me feel better!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can even think about stopping her, the bimbo cat-girl reaches down beneath her desk, and, producing a glowing-pink lollipop, she wraps her plump lips around it and starts sucking. Immediately, you see her cheeks flush red, and with complete indifference to your presence before her, she drops her hands down between her legs, before pulling her skirt up and reaching down into her thong to start masturbating. 
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Fuck, like, the<i>sh</i>e thing<i>sh</i> are pretty good,)] she slurps around the lollipop in her mouth, before looking up into your eyes and pleading, [candi.speechNoEffects(I'm <i>sh</i>o horny! Like, plea<i>sh</i>e! Come round here and fuck me!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With any animosity towards you seemingly forgotten, Candi continues desperately pleading for you to fuck her, and you wonder if you should take her up on her offer, or simply take your leave and see to the arrangements for your new slave...
